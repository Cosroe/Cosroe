## Hallo!

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering with a specialization in Information Engineering at the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences. My bachelor thesis focuses on econometrics, specifically investigating the impact of economic freedom on economic growth within the European Economic Area. Additionally, I am working towards earning the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate to further enhance my data analysis capabilities.

You can connect with me by visiting my [personal page](https://cosroe.github.io/).

Expect regular updates to this page as I add the stuff I am working on/ have finished working on!
